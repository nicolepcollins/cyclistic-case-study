## 💡 Key Findings

- Casual riders consistently took **longer rides than annual members**, even during the winter months of January through March. This suggests many casual riders may be using the service for leisure or tourism rather than commuting.
- The **top end stations for casual riders** were heavily concentrated near Chicago's **lakeshore**, indicating popular recreational areas.
- In contrast, **annual members primarily ended their rides within the Loop**, aligning with patterns typical of local commuters.
- These trends support the idea that casual riders are more likely **tourists or recreational users**, while annual members are typically **local, routine commuters**.
- To support the business goal of **converting casual riders into annual members**, it's recommended to:
  - Conduct further analysis on Q2 data (warmer months) to better identify local casual riders who may be open to membership.
  - **Target marketing efforts**—including print and social media—near high-traffic lakeshore stations to attract potential converts among recreational riders.
